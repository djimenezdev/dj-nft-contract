# DJNFT HARDHAT PROJECT

Utilized hardhat to create a few contracts utilizing the ERC721 and ERC1155
standards. It is some really amazing stuff especially working with hardhat.
You get to develop, compile, test, debug & deploy your contracts all with hardhat
is so powerful for ensuring your smart contracts are mainnet ready!

What is so special with the development environment is you work on hardhats local network node which is great because its local to your machine no one else
can see it but you. And you can deploy straight from hardhat to the network of
your choice when you are confident its ready to be used on a testnet or even the ethereum mainnet.

I will be posting on how to utilize the core features of hardhat very soon. But if you wanted to get started now, follow this link below to the documentation to get a breakdown of all the core features. They even have a tutorial as well to help!
